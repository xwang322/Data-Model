The EDGE SSD Upgrade Kit for Server converts a 2.5 SSD into a 3.5 SSD making it possible to install into a server that only accepts 3.5 drives. Simply insert a 2.5 SSD into the PCB of the supplied installation bracket and secure with screws (included). When finished the side and bottom mounting holes of the bracket line up with that of a 3.5 drive. The SATA connector of the bracket is offset to match the design specs of a standard 3.5 SATA connector which is critical for a successful install.<BR><BR>The bracket is made from durable SPCC steel and comes in a sleek black finish.

All RS series models feature tweeters mounted at 20-degree angles so that the high frequencies are aimed at the listener not the ground. All RS series speakers utilize a unique Cone Forward(TM) Design which places the drive units as far forward in the fiberglass cabinet as possible. This ensures a transparent open and dynamic sound with precise stereo imaging without the hollow colorations found in traditional rock speaker designs. RS series cabinets are carefully crafted from 4 inter-woven layers of fiberglass and resin. This technique ensures that Niles RS speakers will hold up to the elements and still deliver premium sound quality. RS series speakers are covered by a 5-year limited warranty against defects in materials or workmanship. Niles RS series speakers ship with a 3-foot pigtail of direct burial cable; waterproof wire nuts for secure connection and a security bracket and cable to prevent theft."],"Product Segment":["Electronics"]}?MATCH

Sonnets Transposer is the solution you need - it adapts any 2.5 form factor SATA SSD to any 3.5 form factor drive tray, without cables or hassles. Transposer enables you to readily add SSDs to your system.<BR><BR>How does it work Simply plug in the smaller drive to the Transposers mating connector, secure the drive with the provided screws, and then install the Transposer/drive assembly like you would any 3.5 drive. Offering a tailor-made fit, this Sonnet adapter secures the 2.5 drive from the bottom, making Transposer compatible with drives from 7 mm to 15 mm tall. Standard position mounting holes on Transposers bottom and sides, equivalent to those found on a 3.5 hard drive, give you the flexibility to mount it anywhere a 3.5 drive is used.<BR><BR>Transposer provides a rigid base to secure your SSD or hard drive. Its specially-engineered open-frame aluminum heatsink design delivers effective heat dissipation, especially important to maintain the long-term reliability of high-performance SSDs and hard drives. Transposers fixed mount connectors are attached to a simple circuit board, assuring solid connections betweeen devices, and the outside connector is positioned to plug into a backplane as the tray is inserted. Other advantages of this simple design include great compatibility and undiminished speed - Transposer is compatible with 3 Gb/s and 6 Gb/s SATA SSDs and hard disk drives. Because no bridge chip is used, Transposer does not cause any loss in data transfer speeds. Transposer takes the guesswork out of securely adapting a 2.5 SSD for use in 3.5 drive tray - it just works!<br><br><h3 id=detailspecs>Specifications</h3><span class=font_size3bold>General</span><br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Device Type: &nbsp;Storage bay adapter<br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Supported Form Factor: &nbsp;3.5 to 2.5<br><br><span class=font_size3bold>Expansion / Connectivity</span><br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Interfaces: &nbsp;1 x SATA 1.5Gb/s - 7 pin Serial ATA<br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Compatible Bays: &nbsp;1 x external 3.5<br><br><span class=font_size3bold>Manufacturer Warranty</span><br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Service & Support: &nbsp;1 year warranty<br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Service & Support Details: &nbsp;Limited warranty - 1 year<br><br><span class=font_size3bold>Dimensions & Weight</span><br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Width: &nbsp;4 in<br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Depth: &nbsp;5.4 in<br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Height: &nbsp;0.7 in<br><!-- END CNET Content -->"],"GTIN":["II67NJbHRr0419"],"Warranty Information":["Y"],"UPC":["67NJbHRr0419"]}?42398263#TigerDirect?{"Product Type":["Electronics Carrying Cases"],"Product Name":["EDGE SSD Upgrade Kit Bracket Adapter for Desktop - Storage bay adapter - 3.5 to 2.5"],"Product Long Description":["<!-- CNET Content -->Many of todays popular SSDs are available in a 2.5 form factor.

The DR-40s four-track recording mode gives you several options to record, indicated by LEDs on the front of the unit. The 4-channel recording modes include:DUAL - Record a stereo signal with a copy of that stereo signal at a lower level. This gives you a safety track you can use in case the main recording is distorted. (See next section for more info). 4CH - Record the built-in microphones along with a pair of external mics, like close-up and ambient microphones. Or record the built-in mics along with a balanced line input, such as the feed from a mixer along with the sound in the room.. OVERDUB - Play along with a recording youve already made to build up a full production or song demo.You can record up to four channels of 96kHz/24-bit audio. Mono and stereo recording is also available. Recording formats include MP3 (from 32 to 320kbps), WAV and Broadcast WAV formats.Dual Recording ModeDual Recording&#160;records a second copy of your performance up to -12dB lower as a safety track. This mean if your recording gets accidentally distorted, youll have a backup copy that isnt distorted. Dual Recording works in addition to the peak limiting and low cut filter features which also prevent distortion. The Dual Recording mode is perfect for recording your band live. Just set the unit to record and hit the stage without worrying about the recording getting blown out.Locking XLR InputsThe DR-40 has a set of Neutrik&#174; locking combination XLR & 1/4 inputs. These external inputs can accept balanced microphone or line inputs. The microphone preamp includes phantom power and plenty of gain for detailed recordings with condenser microphones. The DR-40 is one of the only handheld recorders with a balanced line input, for recording the output of a console or other pro audio source. In 4-channel recording mode, you can record the output of a live console while capturing the sound of the room with the built-in microphones.Adjustable Condenser MicrophonesAttached to the DR-40 are a pair of cardioid condenser microphones. The stereo microphones can be arranged in an XY recording pattern for tight stereo imaging or in an AB pattern for a more ambient recording. When flipping the microphone orientation, the left and right channels automatically flip for correct stereo placement.Useful Playback Features Like most TASCAM handheld recorders, the DR-40 includes playback modes to loop a section of playback or slow it down without changing the pitch, perfect for learning new music. A built-in speaker is included for checking recording without headphones. The Level Align feature smooths out level jumps during playback to help you monitor your raw, unmastered recordings. A stereo reverb effect is available during playback or recording. Another handy additions include a chromatic tuner and tripod mount. Full Feature ListHandheld 4-track Portable Recorder. Built-in condenser microphones, adjustable to XY or AB position. XLR / 1/4 mic/line input with phantom power. Record the built-in microphones with the XLR mic or line input for a four-track recording. Dual recording mode captures a safety track at a lower level to avoid distortion. Overdub mode allows recording along with a previous take . Peak reduction automatically sets the ideal recording level. 15-hour battery life from three AA batteries. Up to 96kHz/24-bit WAV/BWF or MP3 recording resolution. 2-second pre-recording buffer. Variable speed playback from 50-150% speed without changing the pitch. Adjustable limiter and low cut filter (40/80/120 Hz). Built-in speaker and chromatic tuner. 1/8 headphone/line output. Playback EQ and level align. Stereo Reverb effect. Tripod mounting hole.
