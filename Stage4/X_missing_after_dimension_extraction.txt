The EDGE SSD Upgrade Kit for Server converts a 2.5 SSD into a 3.5 SSD making it possible to install into a server that only accepts 3.5 drives. Simply insert a 2.5 SSD into the PCB of the supplied installation bracket and secure with screws (included). When finished the side and bottom mounting holes of the bracket line up with that of a 3.5 drive. The SATA connector of the bracket is offset to match the design specs of a standard 3.5 SATA connector which is critical for a successful install.<BR><BR>The bracket is made from durable SPCC steel and comes in a sleek black finish. Ventilation holes on the bottom of the bracket provide extra cooling to the drive. All needed mounting screws are included.

The switch is powered by an included AC adapter and a green LED on the front panel indicates when power is applied.<br><br>Installation is as simple as plugging the unit into the power adapter and inserting Cat5/Cat5e STP or UTP cables into the ports on the back. The switch automatically detects the use of straight (MDI) or crossover (MDIX) cables and switches the connection to whichever is needed for the connected device. Therefore any of the eight ports can be connected to the upstream hub or router and the others connected to downstream PCs hubs or other switches.<br><br>This Monoprice switch has an integrated 1K MAC address table and supports MAC address auto-learning and auto-aging.

Sonnets Transposer is the solution you need - it adapts any 2.5 form factor SATA SSD to any 3.5 form factor drive tray, without cables or hassles. Transposer enables you to readily add SSDs to your system.<BR><BR>How does it work Simply plug in the smaller drive to the Transposers mating connector, secure the drive with the provided screws, and then install the Transposer/drive assembly like you would any 3.5 drive. Offering a tailor-made fit, this Sonnet adapter secures the 2.5 drive from the bottom, making Transposer compatible with drives from 7 mm to 15 mm tall. Standard position mounting holes on Transposers bottom and sides, equivalent to those found on a 3.5 hard drive, give you the flexibility to mount it anywhere a 3.5 drive is used.<BR><BR>Transposer provides a rigid base to secure your SSD or hard drive. Its specially-engineered open-frame aluminum heatsink design delivers effective heat dissipation, especially important to maintain the long-term reliability of high-performance SSDs and hard drives. Transposers fixed mount connectors are attached to a simple circuit board, assuring solid connections betweeen devices, and the outside connector is positioned to plug into a backplane as the tray is inserted. Other advantages of this simple design include great compatibility and undiminished speed - Transposer is compatible with 3 Gb/s and 6 Gb/s SATA SSDs and hard disk drives. Because no bridge chip is used, Transposer does not cause any loss in data transfer speeds. Transposer takes the guesswork out of securely adapting a 2.5 SSD for use in 3.5 drive tray - it just works!<br><br><h3 id=detailspecs>Specifications</h3><span class=font_size3bold>General</span><br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Device Type: &nbsp;Storage bay adapter<br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Supported Form Factor: &nbsp;3.5 to 2.5<br><br><span class=font_size3bold>Expansion / Connectivity</span><br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Interfaces: &nbsp;1 x SATA 1.5Gb/s - 7 pin Serial ATA<br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Compatible Bays: &nbsp;1 x external 3.5<br><br><span class=font_size3bold>Manufacturer Warranty</span><br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Service & Support: &nbsp;1 year warranty<br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Service & Support Details: &nbsp;Limited warranty - 1 year<br><br><span class=font_size3bold>Dimensions & Weight</span><br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Width: &nbsp;4 in<br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Depth: &nbsp;5.4 in<br>&nbsp;<img align=absmiddle src=http://images.highspeedbackbone.net/main/gfx-blkbullet.jpg>&nbsp;&nbsp;Height: &nbsp;0.7 in<br><!-- END CNET Content -->"],"GTIN":["II67NJbHRr0419"],"Warranty Information":["Y"],"UPC":["67NJbHRr0419"]}?42398263#TigerDirect?{"Product Type":["Electronics Carrying Cases"],"Product Name":["EDGE SSD Upgrade Kit Bracket Adapter for Desktop - Storage bay adapter - 3.5 to 2.5"],"Product Long Description":["<!-- CNET Content -->Many of todays popular SSDs are available in a 2.5 form factor.

The newly redesigned eTrex lineup will retain the core functionality such as rugged construction and long battery life that made eTrex famous while adding capabilities normally found in premium handhelds. An already easy-to-use device has gotten easier thanks to an improved user interface complimented by an &quot;updated&quot; look with refinements such as buttons identified by text.<br/><br/>Legacy customers such as hunters/hikers will continue to be drawn to eTrex but the new features will expand its appeal. A geocacher will notice paperless geocaching and the ability to wirelessly share caches. Geocachers can help the environment and be more efficient by going paperless with the eTrex series quickly downloading cache information directly to the device. Each model stores and displays cache information such as location terrain difficulty hints and description so that you dont have to tote printouts with you. Learn more about geocaching such as how to get started or go paperless at www.garmin.com/geocaching and www.OpenCaching.com.
